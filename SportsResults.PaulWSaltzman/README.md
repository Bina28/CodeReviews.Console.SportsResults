# Sports Result Notifier

# Requirements
	- [x] This is an application where you should read sports data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.
	- [x] You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
	- [x] The data should be collected from the Basketball Reference Website in the resources area.
	- [x] You should use the Agility Pack library for scrapping.

	Challanges
	- [x] Getting the hang of agility pack was pretty easy.  I would like to spend some more time with the tool to see what all it can do.  
	- [x] Figuring out the layout of the program took a bit.  I ended up writing as a single file and then refactoring.  

	Notes
	- [x] Before using make sure you fill out the setting in app config and the list of emails to send to.  
	- [x] The idea is to use scheduler to run this daily.
