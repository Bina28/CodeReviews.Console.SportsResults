# Sports Results Web Scraper
This app scrapes https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/ to get daily basketball score data.

# TO-DO
Maybe make it a cron job or automate it to scrape daily.  I made a App.config file and ignored it in my gitignore file.  Update it by making an app and a password in gmail settings to bypass authentication issues and adjust code to update emailFromAddress and emailToAddress in the EmailClient class.
